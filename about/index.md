I'm Subi Zhang from Beijing, China. Currently I am a graduate student of University of British Columbia learning data science. I enjoy cooking, reading, singing and watching shows in my life.

***"Serendipity"*** is my favorite English word. It means ***"the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way"*** based on Oxford Dictionary's definition. It's just like I once ever met a giant "fried egg" (wild jellyfish in fact) in a lake  that was floating  under my nose during a kayaking trip. I have a crush on this kind of accidental joy:) And I believe data science is such a powerful detector that may help me explore more serendipity within my spiritual life.

I hope I could keep recording and sharing my thinking in this quiet nook.
