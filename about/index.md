Hey, the guy who happens to find this secret corner. Glad to meet you here :)

I'm Subi Zhang from Beijing, China. Currently I am a graduate student of University of British Columbia learning data science.

I enjoy singing, cooking, reading and watching shows in my life.

*"Serendipity"* is my favorite English word. It means *the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way* based on Oxford Dictionary's definition. I believe data science is such a powerful detector that may help me explore more serendipity within my spiritual life. And I wish I could keep recording and sharing my thinking in this quiet nook.
